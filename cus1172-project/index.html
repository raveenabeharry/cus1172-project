      <h2>Hi, I'm Raveena <img src= "barcelona.JPG" width= 30% alt="Me in Barcelona!"> </h2>

      <h3>I'm a senior at St. John's University studying computer science with a double minor in business administration and
        international studies. </h3>

      <h3>As a senior I've taken most of the required computer science classes and am mainly taking electives now.
        One of my favorite computer science classes would be Data Security and Cryptography, which I am currently taking.
        My favorite class I've ever taken in college is GLOBE, which is in the business school. In this class I learned about microfinance
        in the context of working with entreprenuers in developing countries. The highlight of my college career
        would be studying abroad last semester in Ireland, France and Italy! </h3>
