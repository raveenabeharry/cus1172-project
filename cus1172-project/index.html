        administration and international studies. <img src= "cus1172-project/positanoPhoto.jpg" alt="Me in Positano"></h3>

      <h3>As a senior I've taken most of the required computer science classes and am mainly taking electives now.
        One of my favorite computer science classes is Data Security and Cryptography, which I am currently taking.
        My favorite class I've ever taken is GLOBE, which is in the business school. In this class I learned about microfinance in the
